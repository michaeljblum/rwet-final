What’s that?

An egg?

By the brothers Boot it stinks fresh.

Give it to Gillot.



Galileo how are you

and his consecutive thirds!

The vile old Copernican lead-swinging son of a sutler!

We’re moving he said we’re off – Porca Madonna!

the way a boatswain would be, or a sack-of-potatoey charging Pretender.

That’s not moving, that’s moving.



What’s that?

A little green fry or a mushroomy one?

Two lashed ovaries with prostisciutto?

How long did she womb it, the feathery one?

Three days and four nights?

Give it to Gillot.



Faulhaber, Beeckman and Peter the Red,

come now in the cloudy avalanche or Gassendi’s sun-red crystally cloud

and I’ll pebble you all your hen-and-a-half ones

or I’ll pebble a lens under the quilt in the midst of day.



To think he was my own brother, Peter the Bruiser,

and not a syllogism out of him

no more than if Pa were still in it.

Hey! pass over those coppers,

sweet millèd sweat of my burning liver!

Them were the days I sat in the hot-cupboard throwing Jesuits out of the skylight.



Who’s that? Hals?

Let him wait.



My squinty doaty!

I hid and you sook.

And Francine my precious fruit of a house-and-parlour foetus!

What an exfoliation!

Her little grey flayed epidermis and scarlet tonsils!

My one child

scourged by a fever to stagnant murky blood –

blood!

Oh Harvey belovèd

how shall the red and white, the many in the few,

(dear bloodswirling Harvey)

eddy through that cracked beater?

And the fourth Henry came to the crypt of the arrow.



What’s that?

How long?

Sit on it.



A wind of evil flung my despair of ease

against the sharp spires of the one

lady:

not once or twice but….

(Kip of Christ hatch it!)

in one sun’s drowning

(Jesuitasters please copy).

So on with the silk hose over the knitted, and the morbid leather –

what am I saying! the gentle canvas –

and away to Ancona on the bright Adriatic,

and farewell for a space to the yellow key of the Rosicrucians.

They don’t know what the master of them that do did,

that the nose is touched by the kiss of all foul and sweet air,

and the drums, and the throne of the faecal inlet,

and the eyes by its zig-zags.


So we drink Him and eat Him

and the watery Beaune and the stale cubes of Hovis

because He can jig

as near or as far from His Jigging Self

and as sad or lively as the chalice or the tray asks.

How’s that, Antonio?



In the name of Bacon will you chicken me up that egg.

Shall I swallow cave-phantoms?



Anna Maria!

She reads Moses and says her love is crucified.


Leider! Leider! she bloomed and withered,

a pale abusive parakeet in a mainstreet window.



No I believe every word of it I assure you.

Fallor, ergo sum!

The coy old frôleur!

He tolle’d and legge’d

and he buttoned on his redemptorist waistcoat.

No matter, let it pass.

I’m a bold boy I know

so I’m not my son


(even if I were a concierge)

nor Joachim my father’s

but the chip of a perfect block that’s neither old nor new,

the lonely petal of a great high bright rose.



Are you ripe at last,

my slim pale double-breasted turd?

How rich she smells,

this abortion of a fledgling!

I will eat it with a fish fork.

White and yolk and feathers.

Then I will rise and move moving 90

toward Rahab of the snows,

the murdering matinal pope-confessed amazon,

Christina the ripper.

Oh Weulles spare the blood of a Frank

who has climbed the bitter steps,

(René du Perron …!)

and grant me my second

starless inscrutable hour.



Gnome




Spend the years of learning squandering

Courage for the years of wandering

Through a world politely turning

From the loutishness of learning.





Echo’s Bones and Other Precipitates





The Vulture




dragging his hunger through the sky

of my skull shell of sky and earth



stooping to the prone who must

soon take up their life and walk



mocked by a tissue that may not serve

till hunger earth and sky be offal





Enueg I




Exeo in a spasm

tired of my darling’s red sputum

from the Portobello Private Nursing Home

its secret things

and toil to the crest of the surge of the steep perilous bridge

and lapse down blankly under the scream of the hoarding

round the bright stiff banner of the hoarding

into a black west

throttled with clouds.



Above the mansions the algum-trees

the mountains

my skull sullenly

clot of anger

skewered aloft strangled in the cang of the wind

bites like a dog against its chastisement.



I trundle along rapidly now on my ruined feet

flush with the livid canal;

at Parnell Bridge a dying barge

carrying a cargo of nails and timber

rocks itself softly in the foaming cloister of the lock;

on the far bank a gang of down and outs would seem to be mending a beam.



Then for miles only wind

and the weals creeping alongside on the water

and the world opening up to the south

across a travesty of champaign to the mountains

and the stillborn evening turning a filthy green

manuring the night fungus

and the mind annulled

wrecked in wind.



I splashed past a little wearish old man,

Democritus,

scuttling along between a crutch and a stick,

his stump caught up horribly, like a claw, under his breech, smoking.

Then because a field on the left went up in a sudden blaze

of shouting and urgent whistling and scarlet and blue ganzies

I stopped and climbed the bank to see the game.

A child fidgeting at the gate called up:

‘Would we be let in Mister?’

‘Certainly’ I said ‘you would.’

But, afraid, he set off down the road.

‘Well’ I called after him ‘why wouldn’t you go on in?’

‘Oh’ he said, knowingly,

‘I was in that field before and I got put out.’

So on,

derelict,

as from a bush of gorse on fire in the mountain after dark,

or in Sumatra the jungle hymen,

the still flagrant rafflesia.



Next:

a lamentable family of grey verminous hens,

perishing out in the sunk field,

trembling, half asleep, against the closed door of a shed,

with no means of roosting.

The great mushy toadstool,

green-black,

oozing up after me,

soaking up the tattered sky like an ink of pestilence,

in my skull the wind going fetid,

the water …



Next:

on the hill down from the Fox and Geese into Chapelizod

a small malevolent goat, exiled on the road,

remotely pucking the gate of his field;

the Isolde Stores a great perturbation of sweaty heroes,

in their Sunday best,

come hastening down for a pint of nepenthe or moly or half and half

from watching the hurlers above in Kilmainham.



Blotches of doomed yellow in the pit of the Liffey;

the fingers of the ladders hooked over the parapet,

soliciting;

a slush of vigilant gulls in the grey spew of the sewer.



Ah the banner

the banner of meat bleeding

on the silk of the seas and the arctic flowers

that do not exist.





Enueg II




world world world world

and the face grave

cloud against the evening



de morituris nihil nisi



and the face crumbling shyly

too late to darken the sky

blushing away into the evening

shuddering away like a gaffe



veronica mundi

veronica munda

gives us a wipe for the love of Jesus



sweating like Judas

tired of dying

tired of policemen

feet in marmalade

perspiring profusely

heart in marmalade

smoke more fruit

the old heart the old heart

breaking outside congress

doch I assure thee



lying on O’Connell Bridge



goggling at the tulips of the evening

the green tulips

shining round the corner like an anthrax

shining on Guinness’s barges



the overtone the face

too late to brighten the sky

doch doch I assure thee





Alba




before morning you shall be here

and Dante and the Logos and all strata and mysteries

and the branded moon

beyond the white plane of music

that you shall establish here before morning



grave suave singing silk

stoop to the black firmament of areca

rain on the bamboos flower of smoke alley of willows



who though you stoop with fingers of compassion

to endorse the dust

shall not add to your bounty

whose beauty shall be a sheet before me

a statement of itself drawn across the tempest of emblems

so that there is no sun and no unveiling

and no host

only I and then the sheet

and bulk dead





Dortmunder




In the magic the Homer dusk

past the red spire of sanctuary

I null she royal hulk

hasten to the violet lamp to the thin K’in music of the bawd.

She stands before me in the bright stall

sustaining the jade splinters

the scarred signaculum of purity quiet

the eyes the eyes black till the plagal east

shall resolve the long night phrase.

Then, as a scroll, folded,

and the glory of her dissolution enlarged

in me, Habbakuk, mard of all sinners.

Schopenhauer is dead, the bawd

puts her lute away.





Sanies I




all the livelong way this day of sweet showers from Portrane on the seashore

Donabate sad swans of Turvey Swords

pounding along in three ratios like a sonata

like a Ritter with pommelled scrotum atra cura on the step

Botticelli from the fork down pestling the transmission

tires bleeding voiding zeep the highway

all heaven in the sphincter

the sphincter



müüüüüüüde now

potwalloping now through the promenaders

this trusty all-steel this super-real

bound for home like a good boy

where I was born with a pop with the green of the larches

ah to be back in the caul now with no trusts

no fingers no spoilt love

belting along in the meantime clutching the bike

the billows of the nubile the cere wrack

pot-valiant caulless waisted in rags hatless

for mamma papa chicken and ham

warm Grave too say the word

happy days snap the stem shed a tear

this day Spy Wedsday seven pentades past

oh the larches the pain drawn like a cork

the glans he took the day off up hill and down dale

with a ponderous fawn from the Liverpool London and Globe

back the shadows lengthen the sycomores are sobbing

to roly-poly oh to me a spanking boy

buckets of fizz childbed is thirsty work

for the midwife he is gory

for the proud parent he washes down a gob of gladness

for footsore Achates also he pants his pleasure

sparkling beestings for me

tired now hair ebbing gums ebbing ebbing home

good as gold now in the prime after a brief prodigality

yea and suave

suave urbane beyond good and evil

biding my time without rancour you may take your oath

distraught half-crooked courting the sneers of these fauns these smart nymphs

clipped like a pederast as to one trouser-end

sucking in my bloated lantern behind a Wild Woodbine

cinched to death in a filthy slicker

flinging the proud Swift forward breasting the swell of Stürmers

I see main verb at last

her whom alone in the accusative

I have dismounted to love

gliding towards me dauntless nautch-girl on the face of the waters

dauntless daughter of desires in the old black and flamingo

get along with you now take the six the seven the eight or the little single-decker

take a bus for all I care walk cadge a lift

home to the cob of your web in Holles Street

and let the tiger go on smiling

in our hearts that funds ways home





Sanies II




there was a happy land

the American Bar

in Rue Mouffetard

there were red eggs there

I have a dirty I say henorrhoids

coming from the bath

the steam the delight the sherbet

the chagrin of the old skinnymalinks

slouching happy body

loose in my stinking old suit

sailing slouching up to Puvis the gauntlet of tulips

lash lash me with yaller tulips I will let down

my stinking old trousers

my love she sewed up the pockets alive the live-oh she did she said that was better

spotless then within the brown rags gliding

frescoward free up the fjord of dyed eggs and thongbells

I disappear don’t you know into the local

the mackerel are at billiards there they are crying the scores

the Barfrau makes a big impression with her mighty bottom

Dante and blissful Beatrice are there

prior to Vita Nuova

the balls splash no luck comrade

Gracieuse is there Belle-Belle down the drain

booted Percinet with his cobalt jowl

they are necking gobble-gobble

suck is not suck that alters

lo Alighieri has got off au revoir to all that

I break down quite in a titter of despite

hark

upon the saloon a terrible hush

a shiver convulses Madame de la Motte

it courses it peals down her collops

the great bottom foams into stillness

quick quick the cavaletto supplejacks for mumbo-jumbo

vivas puellas mortui incurrrrrsant boves

oh subito subito ere she recover the cang bamboo for bastinado

a bitter moon fessade à la mode

oh Becky spare me I have done thee no wrong spare me damn thee

spare me good Becky

call off thine adders Becky I will compensate thee in full

Lord have mercy upon

Christ have mercy upon us



Lord have mercy upon us





Serena I




without the grand old British Museum

Thales and the Aretino

on the bosom of the Regent’s Park the phlox

crackles under the thunder

scarlet beauty in our world dead fish adrift

all things full of gods

pressed down and bleeding

a weaver-bird is tangerine the harpy is past caring

the condor likewise in his mangy boa

they stare out across monkey-hill the elephants

Ireland

the light creeps down their old home canyon

sucks me aloof to that old reliable

the burning btm of George the drill

ah across the way a adder

broaches her rat

white as snow

in her dazzling oven strom of peristalsis

limae labor



ah father father that art in heaven



I find me taking the Crystal Palace

for the Blessed Isles from Primrose Hill

alas I must be that kind of person

hence in Ken Wood who shall find me

my breath held in the midst of thickets

none but the most quarried lovers



I surprise me moved by the many a funnel hinged

for the obeisance to Tower Bridge

the viper’s curtsy to and from the City

till in the dusk a lighter

blind with pride

tosses aside the scarf of the bascules

then in the grey hold of the ambulance

throbbing on the brink ebb of sighs

then I hug me below among the canaille

until a guttersnipe blast his cernèd eyes

demanding ’ave I done with the Mirror

I stump off in a fearful rage under Married Men’s Quarters

Bloody Tower

and afar off at all speed screw me up Wren’s giant bully

and curse the day caged panting on the platform

under the flaring urn

I was not born Defoe



but in Ken Wood

who shall find me



my brother the fly

the common housefly

sidling out of darkness into light

fastens on his place in the sun

whets his six legs

revels in his planes his poisers

it is the autumn of his life

he could not serve typhoid and mammon





Serena II




this clonic earth



see-saw she is blurred in sleep

she is fat half dead the rest is free-wheeling

part the black shag the pelt

is ashen woad

snarl and howl in the wood wake all the birds

hound the harlots out of the ferns

this damfool twilight threshing in the brake

bleating to be bloodied

this crapulent hush

tear its heart out



in her dreams she trembles again

way back in the dark old days panting

in the claws of the Pins in the stress of her hour

the bag writhes she thinks she is dying

the light fails it is time to lie down

Clew Bay vat of xanthic flowers

Croagh Patrick waned Hindu to spite a pilgrim

she is ready she has lain down above all the islands of glory

straining now this Sabbath evening of garlands

with a yo-heave-ho of able-bodied swans

out from the doomed land their reefs of tresses

in a hag she drops her young

the whales in Blacksod Bay are dancing

the asphodels come running the flags after

she thinks she is dying she is ashamed



she took me up on to a watershed

whence like the rubrics of a childhood

behold Meath shining through a chink in the hills

posses of larches there is no going back on

a rout of tracks and streams fleeing to the sea

kindergartens of steeples and then the harbour

like a woman making to cover her breasts

and left me



with whatever trust of panic we went out

with so much shall we return

there shall be no loss of panic between a man and his dog

bitch though he be



sodden packet of Churchman

muzzling the cairn

it is worse than dream

the light randy slut can’t be easy

this clonic earth

all these phantoms shuddering out of focus

it is useless to close the eyes

all the chords of the earth broken like a woman pianist’s

the toads abroad again on their rounds

sidling up to their snares

the fairy-tales of Meath ended

so say your prayers now and go to bed

your prayers before the lamps start to sing behind the larches

here at these knees of stone

then to bye-bye on the bones





Serena III




fix this pothook of beauty on this palette

you never know it might be final



or leave her she is paradise and then

plush hymens on your eyeballs



or on Butt Bridge blush for shame

the mixed declension of those mammae

cock up thy moon thine and thine only

up up up to the star of evening

swoon upon the arch-gasometer

on Misery Hill brand-new carnation

swoon upon the little purple

house of prayer

something heart of Mary

the Bull and Pool Beg that will never meet

not in this world



whereas dart away through the cavorting scapes

bucket o’er Victoria Bridge that’s the idea

slow down slink down the Ringsend Road

Irishtown Sandymount puzzle find the Hell Fire

the Merrion Flats scored with a thrillion sigmas

Jesus Christ Son of God Saviour His Finger

girls taken strippin that’s the idea

on the Bootersgrad breakwind and water

the tide making the dun gulls in a panic

the sands quicken in your hot heart

hide yourself not in the Rock keep on the move

keep on the move





Malacoda




thrice he came

the undertaker’s man

impassible behind his scutal bowler

to measure

is he not paid to measure

this incorruptible in the vestibule

this malebranca knee-deep in the lilies

Malacoda knee-deep in the lilies

Malacoda for all the expert awe

that felts his perineum mutes his signal

sighing up through the heavy air

must it be it must be it must be

find the weeds engage them in the garden

hear she may see she need not



to coffin

with assistant ungulata

find the weeds engage their attention

hear she must see she need not



to cover

to be sure cover cover all over

your targe allow me hold your sulphur

divine dogday glass set fair

stay Scarmilion stay stay

lay this Huysum on the box

mind the imago it is he

hear she must see she must

all aboard all souls

half-mast aye aye



nay





Da Tagte Es




redeem the surrogate goodbyes

the sheet astream in your hand

who have no more for the land

and the glass unmisted above your eyes





Echo’s Bones




asylum under my tread all this day

their muffled revels as the flesh falls

breaking without fear or favour wind

the gantelope of sense and nonsense run

taken by the maggots for what they are



* * *





Yoke of Liberty




The lips of her desire are grey

and parted like a silk loop

threatening

a slight wanton wound.

She preys wearily

on sensitive wild things

proud to be torn

by the grave crouch of her beauty.

But she will die and her snare

tendered so patiently

to my tamed watchful sorrow

will break and hang

in a pitiful crescent.





Antipepsis




And the number was uneven

In the green of holy Stephen

Where before the ass the cart

Was harnessed for a foreign part.

In this should not be seen the sign

Of hasard, no, but of design,

For of the two, by common consent,

The cart was the more intelligent.

Whose exceptionally pia

Mater hatched this grand idea

Is not known. He or she,

Smiling, unmolested, free,

By this one act the mind become

A providential vacuum,

Continues still to stroll amok,

To eat, drink, piss, shit, fart and fuck,

Assuming that the fucking season

Did not expire with that of reason.

Now through the city spreads apace

The cry: A thought has taken place!

A human thought! Ochone! Ochone!

Purissima Virgo! We’re undone!

Bitched, buggered and bewilderèd!

Bring forth your dead! Bring forth your dead!

why not merely the despaired of

occasion of

wordshed



is it not better abort than be barren



the hours after you are gone are so leaden

they will always start dragging too soon

the grapples clawing blindly the bed of want

bringing up the bones the old loves

sockets filled once with eyes like yours

all always is it better too soon than never

the black want splashing their faces

saying again nine days never floated the loved

nor nine months

nor nine lives

saying again

if you do not teach me I shall not learn

saying again there is a last

even of last times

last times of begging

last times of loving

of knowing not knowing pretending

a last even of last times of saying

if you do not love me I shall not be loved

if I do not love you I shall not love



the churn of stale words in the heart again

love love love thud of the old plunger

pestling the unalterable

whey of words



terrified again

of not loving

of loving and not you

of being loved and not by you

of knowing not knowing pretending

pretending



I and all the others that will love you

if they love you

offer it up plank it down

Golgotha was only the potegg

cancer angina it is all one to us

cough up your T.B. don’t be stingy

no trifle is too trifling not even a thrombus

anything venereal is especially welcome

that old toga in the mothballs

don’t be sentimental you won’t be wanting it again

send it along we’ll put it in the pot with the rest

with your love requited and unrequited

the things taken too late the things taken too soon

the spirit aching bullock’s scrotum

you won’t cure it you won’t endure it

it is you it equals you any fool has to pity you

so parcel up the whole issue and send it along

the whole misery diagnosed undiagnosed misdiagnosed

get your friends to do the same we’ll make use of it

we’ll make sense of it we’ll put it in the pot with the rest

it all boils down to blood of lamb


Saint-Lô

Vire will wind in other shadows

unborn through the bright ways tremble

and the old mind ghost-forsaken

sink into its havoc

my way is in the sand flowing

between the shingle and the dune

the summer rain rains on my life

on me my life harrying fleeing

to its beginning to its end

my peace is there in the receding mist

when I may cease from treading these long shifting thresholds

and live the space of a door

that opens and shuts


what would I do without this world faceless incurious

where to be lasts but an instant where every instant

spills in the void the ignorance of having been

without this wave where in the end

body and shadow together are engulfed

what would I do without this silence where the murmurs die

the pantings the frenzies towards succour towards love

without this sky that soars

above its ballast dust



what would I do what I did yesterday and the day before

peering out of my deadlight looking for another

wandering like me eddying far from all the living

in a convulsive space

among the voices voiceless

that throng my hiddenness

I would like my love to die

and the rain to be raining on the graveyard

and on me walking the streets

mourning her who thought she loved me





Song




Age is when to a man

Huddled o’er the ingle

Shivering for the hag

To put the pan in the bed

And bring the toddy

She comes in the ashes

Who loved could not be won

Or won not loved

Or some other trouble

Comes in the ashes

Like in that old light

The face in the ashes

That old starlight

On the earth again.

Something there

it is gone and the whole globe

Better on your arse than on your feet,

Flat on your back than either, dead than the lot.
