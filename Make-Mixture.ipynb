when I heard them as when first spoken, Sir, I need you.\\nof out spread\\nand the goblet of dyed linen\\n  Newcastle boss Graeme Souness We deserved the win\\nAnd seeing I suppose from my expression, which frequently betrays me, that she had made herself understood, she must have said, If he understands that he can understand anything.\\nvast in\\nwarm Grave too say the word\\n We had a really good second half\\nAnd she was not mistaken, for after some time I found myself in possession of certain ideas or points of view which could only have come to me from her, namely that having killed her dog I was morally obliged to help her carry it home and bury it, that she did not wish to prosecute me for what I had done, but that it was not always possible to do as one did not wish, that she found me likeable enough in spite of my hideous appearance and would be happy to hold out to me a helping hand, and so on, I’ve forgotten the half of it.\\nthe highmost\\nwarm Water too like to

have told me, for that was an insinuation I could not decently pass over in silence as I had the rest, and I made no bones about telling her I needed neither her nor anyone else, which was perhaps a slight exaggeration, for I must have needed my mother, otherwise why this frenzy of wanting to get to her?\\nasylum head\\nbefore dawn\\n Goals Bowyer  Dyer \\nThat is one of the many reasons why I avoid speaking as much as possible.\\nsole blot\\noh the stiff morning sun\\n Subs Not Used Jaidi Poole\\nFor I always say either too much or too little, which is a terrible thing for a man with a passion for truth like mine.\\nfaster than where\\nflush up his lute\\n Booked Ben Haim Hierro\\nAnd I shall not abandon this subject, to which I shall probably never have occasion to return, with such a storm blowing up, without making this curious observation, that it often happened to me, before I gave up speaking for good, to think I had said too little when in fact I had said too much and in fact to have said too little when I thought I had said too much.\\nin hellice eyes\\nquick quick the master cylinders the shame of it\\n Goals Giannakopoulos \\nI mean that on reflection, in the long run rather, my verbal profusion turned out to be penury, and inversely.\\nstream till\\nquick quick the jowl of it\\n Att  Ref S Dunn Gloucestershire\\nSo time sometimes turns the

stork\\nmake no mistake he he he he\\n But we stood up and credit to us we didnt capitulate\\nFor to say I needed no one was not to say too much, but an infinitesimal part of what I should have said, could not have said, should never have said.\\nclack chatter\\nthis he he\\n Well kick on now\\nNeed of my mother!\\ncome through\\nthis he\\nSubs Not Used Cooper Knight\\nNo, there were no words for

marks of the foreskin\\nKonchesky Hreidarsson Perry\\nAnd now enough of this boulevard, it must have been a boulevard, of all these righteous ones, these guardians of the peace, all these feet and hands, stamping, clutching, clenched in vain, these bawling mouths that never bawl out of season, this sky beginning to drip, enough of being abroad, trapped, visible.\\nwith white\\nand all strata

Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match\\nWe slung him across the saddle and set off like an army in retreat, helping each other I suppose, to keep the corpse from falling, to keep the bicycle moving, to keep ourselves moving, through the jeering crowd.\\nashen smooth\\ngliding along between two lamps\\n United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval\\nThe house where Sophie—no, I can’t call her that any more, I’ll try calling her Lousse, without the Mrs—the house where Lousse lived was not far away.\\naghast\\neterned a hag, panting\\nColgan Dodds

leg supports the weight of the body while the other, flexing and unflexing, drives the spade into the earth.\\nin out as dead\\nwhence like the great mixed-martini\\nMiller  McAllister \\nNow my sick leg, I forget which, it’s immaterial here, was in a condition neither to dig, because it was rigid, nor alone to support me, because it would have collapsed.\\nRoundelay\\nand the sudden
