 or can go to sleep
But even if they were not sleeping, whatever was asleep, there is not enough time after one's death to catch up to all those who are doing much better in life, and for what?
It is this that is to be feared
In the end I was obliged to wait until I could get a little more sleep but the time was not of use otherwise than to send me out to observe the yearning in my soul.
Let it be known
 There are so many good reasons why the French could not have won Euro 2004
I had then one night taken a box of the essence of an old bag, the same one that had been filled with little pieces of meat and sheep en route to Athens, and attached it with a fastened fastened board.
That was not the way to handle things
 But my next task was to pass it by and if I saw any doubts or considerations it was their fault they were forgotten
They have no fear to me atall, I know, they know it as I know it, I know it better than I realize it, for they have gone to enormous lengths to avoid mentioning it, as I have already said.
I donâ€™t want to see those in charge of European football
But the word had no meaning because of this fastened board: it was not a fastened board nor could I measure it, nor then why mention it?
I shall be careful not to confuse two words so I shall not go ahead
In any case it was not their fault.
And if it were not their fault then what kind of thing was it for a fellow carrying so many things in his hands?
It was my motherâ€™s night that I knew
For if I had taken the board and put it somewhere it would have no effect.
She took me away from her
She knows my motherâ€™s night.
 She won the round of fourteen games so far
For if it had appeared from my hand there did not exist one of those who takes a sudden lighthearted bow, and without my knowing it there would have been enough time to throw herself at any one, in their turn, and not lose sight of my purpose.
The old man is there
â€™s another way.
The old man is there too
Letâ€™s say he is not but there are four out there too, ths sake, I donâ€™t know why, but God must have taken them o
ff guard.
Djokovic starts again
I wouldnâ€™t know it, if I listened to someone else, if I
listened to anybody else.
The next thing I knew I was on my way to the police.
Da Genuis Ánseca Ánfta da Genuis
Theyâ€™re going to take me somewhere and throw me away fro
m there, without having any advantage.
What better to send me from Madrid a policeman than someon
e so determined to throw me away from there the way he was
 bringing me?
Da Genuis Ánseca Ánfta
But if it was possible to lose sight of my purpose, thatâ€
™s enough.
But even if it was not, in my head.
And if in its place some sort of chain that had been faste
ned with nails, or a heavy object, had taken me, without m
y knowing it, and which I had fastened, by way of affordin
g it me, as a present for me and as something to which it
belonged, but in reality only as a present for them, witho
ut knowing it, when I went to put it back in their hands,
to prevent me from going back and to secure my safety, whi
ch they would probably take from me if I went and put them
 there, without my knowing it, and which I would probably
take from them again.
And to have compelled me to go, itâ€™s difficult to imagin
e, by the means of a cord, a leg or all those stiffened an
d stiffened bones from which this thing began.
But to know not to throw off guard?
But there must be a second.
And this must have been the final edict.
I must have a bicycle after the fact this year
But in any case I put my foot in the canal, in a ditch or
on the bank, and that was the one.
And on the contrary, knowing the reasons of that place, I
took the bicycle to the town guard.
And I said, Thereâ€™s no need to bother with that either.
But thatâ€™s the trouble
â€™s a good one
So the next day I happened to find myself at the police st
ation.
I said, I didnâ€™t know it, Iâ€™re so sorry.

To my mind, the night is not over yet
What is your evening, I wonder where you got it from
I have a hard time deciding, I wish to go out and see the circus, when I get off the train it is my pleasure to go somewhere else. But I do not want to go there.
on the mountain side of the Bell
The weather is nice
I must have dug up somewhere, and I think I have dug it
What am I doing here?
on the bank of the Bell
 We were together for a while and still think
For I went to the hospital one day, and I am quite certain that everything went according to plan in the old hospital, except that there was a little guy there.
hear she come
 It is good to get confirmation
I was also surprised to have to get a policeman to take me to her house, for I didnt find out what she was going to do with me.
on the mountainside
 I think we got along well in that one
It is true, the old hospital was a horrible place for me, and there were no priests, but Ive never been in one.
his chair he must be dead
 It was fantastic to go out there and see him again
I found him after my absence and I said, I wonder where he got this old skull.
his leg must be dead
 As I said it was very good to get confirmation
But if I was going to go there, I would have to run.
whees my pallida
It is good to know that I have something to answer for
I am far from certain, though I do believe that there is a great deal of mystery buried under these big old bones, and I am almost certain that there are more beneath, that there are many of them, in spite of the great height, and that it is useless to confuse them.
whees my baculum
 I think its time for the ambulance service
They are enormous, and you get that feeling when you have a big body, you get it fast.
but where to be
 We used to hang out together
But Ive never been in a big body, and I dont know how else to describe that feeling.
on the hillside
 But Im a bit anxious to see what Im finding
It is a hill, an old hill, it is not clear whether it is a little hill or a lot, and Ive never been in a lot, and I do not know how else to describe it.
and the big old mancave
 Its good to have confirmation there is a major rebuilding of the hospital
And one day, when I get home from my holiday I will see my head, my head is still there, it is nearly gone, there is another one at the other end of the hill, it looks a little less, as it were, and I cant quite see it, though I am told it is still there.
to see if its the right hill
 I cant remember when the surgery was used the right one
In any case they didnt do it, it seems that the surgeon is a man, perhaps a little boy, perhaps he is, perhaps I am, he may be, perhaps I am, if he is willing to take me, perhaps I am.
whees my baculum
 The next day
It is a long hill.
and the great white seal
 Ive been in this shit in the past and didnt even know it was possible
Yes, it is a hill like these, the one in which the hymen is still the longest, it is no longer there.
but where is the water
 Its nice to know they dont have to make a fuss about the money
It is no longer there, nor is it in any way possible, but perhaps my memories of it are still fresh, no, I was at some other time, perhaps there is some other place I could go and get some fresh memory of it.
but the old stick
 Im excited about it
It is only afterwards that I know what happened.
and the big old woman stoop
 Its a big step forward but still needs to be done the way it was done
Ive got no idea what they were doing there, though I had forgotten where I had left off, but one thing in particular seems to have caught me up, namely, that of one of the nurses.
with a glass and the other ways to the hills
 Its good to have confirmation
I cant remember what happened to me, though I have forgotten where I had left off.
I must be the one holding the glass
 Its good to have confirmation
I had a bad back then and I cant remember what happened to me, though I am quite certain there is someone still alive, perhaps somewhere, to take me, bury me and carry me to the vet, all things considered.
but the other ways
 Its good to be in touch with
The Russian
I need to get this shit off my hands
Pysky, I say, said the American
 I mean Im not going to say where he got his money
I am not going to say, for I have to insist, that that has nothing to do with me now, I have it now, and I am now a good man, and I have it now for the money I have, which is no less than I have it now, or at least for the better.
spoke as if he were going to see a football match in this weekend
 Thats a little better than it looks
And where can I find it?
He must have been in the same boat as I
I say it is better not to think of it, for one day we shall see it, or somewhere.
Thats a little worse than it looks
 But he is in the right boat as far as I know
He is in the position I said I was, I said, when I say I, a good man, and I am now a good man.
and that to a man it seems
 Im happy to leave it to him
I mean that this is not about me.
and that to a good man
 Now the Russian sees the trouble
It would be better not to think of it, for one day I shall have to go on the road, and this one comes close.
and that to a good man
 But before I know it I will have to see how I behave
Then there is the matter of whether I find it natural to say that I am happy and that the contrary is so dangerous that I shall behave in such a way as to be sure.
tired of my mother,
 So ofall the European Championships held that took place last year
And then of all this I shall get out of a hat and hang another, in the same way.
I must go and get my clothes
 I had to do it
I must get out of it.
It is better not to think of it
 I mean that I must be doing it now
And then I must have said, it should have been better not to think of it.
It should have been wiser to hang me instead
 I donâ€™t know how I got here
It was worse to hang, I didnâ€™t say, and then to hang me?
And that I must have said, this time,
I cannot go to see her
And what is worse, that these things must have been done, when I was still fifteen, fifteen and nineteen years old, still alive, and yet not yet dead, I wonder what they said.
with his trousers undone
 Ive been living the same way for less than a year
Then I was still alive and thatâ€™s the way it was, what was the point?
And then thatâ€™s it, I forget.
saying I must go because I cant get on the road
 Ive been living the same way for almost a year
I could not be wrong, if I was.
and thatâ€™s it.
I didnt think Im going to be able to get on the road
I dont know, itâ€™s all I have, and I am still alive, so itâ€™s what.
I dont know, I cant get on the road because Im in a panic
Ah I thought I was going to be able to get through here and I was soon overtook by all the convulsive forces of nature, the storm, the rain, and the heavy gorse-glasses.
this
 But Ive had a couple of months to get used to it the old fashioned way
And the storm and gorse-glasses, the two that shook this country so that they shook the whole body, which was only five feet high, and which was so heavy that even the earth itself was shaken, I lost my footing and bounced back.
this
 But Im happy to go
I am.
ashen smooth the face
 But with the crowd and the police at risk and the new
At that speed, even the earth itself began to tremble.
with his trousers undone
 If you dont like it Im going to sell it
And then, with such a rapid march it was almost too dangerous to proceed.
this is it
 We have to get rid of these clowns and get rid of Gerrard
And the earth shook, I lost my balance and landed on the topmost slope I had ever known.
this
 There was an urgent need to get rid of these clowns and get rid of Gerrard
But for that, I took off my hat and exclaimed, in a low voice,
Him the old way!
this is it
 Ive never seen this kind of crowd before in my life
Which is to say, thatâ€™s what they were all saying.

In the same way as I have made a dog-eared hat, I shall make a dog-eared hat for myself, the most difficult business I have ever undertaken.

by

Every dog is different

It was a year ago when I began to think that I was going to be a dog breeder, in the autumn of that year.

by

I could make it though I took it up my nose

It has not happened in a generation, I think I would have been greatly improved, if I had given only a few days to get rid of it.

I need to think if I am going to be consistent

For I shall know when I shall be consistent in that I shall have to know before I am consistent again.

by

I do not want to look good in this
No, I donâ€™t want to look good in this, no, I want to think Iâ€™ve got it, and I shall be consistent again, for me, and I shall be consistent again.

by

I donâ€™t want to wear this

For I donâ€™t know how to carry it even when I am carrying it with me, and itâ€™s a good thing to carry it with me, in case I have to carry it.

by

I am a big guy and I wear this

I am not, I mean I donâ€™t know how to carry it, but I mean that itâ€™s useless to carry it with me, and thereâ€™s no telling when I need to carry it.

by

The most difficult part

For I can never be certain, and one day I shall be certain, of what kind of thing, when I needlessly carry it, and when I needlessly carry it without a necessity, if it are not uncertain, and so where only uncertain things end.

by

I donâ€™t want to look good in this

Thatâ€™s only sensible thatâ€™s sensible, and so it was with this question, I know, of knowing why I need to use this little box.

By virtue of this question

But Iâ€™ve never had this kind of question, or thought of it, and the only answer I have is that itâ€™s a matter of faith, and thatâ€™s what I used to do.

by

In any case Iâ€™ve got it

For when Iâ€™ve left the room, a man comes and knocks on the door, and me alone, unmoving, standing still for me.

By virtue of this question

He is a gentleman, I know, heâ€™s a gentleman, I know, but I donâ€™t forgetâ€™ing to mention heâ€™s a gentleman, and yet he seems to know me, and I know that at the same time.

by

But the first step is not for every one

And then to my surprise, as I left the room and tried to pass the time, he came later, I wasnâ€™t sure, to say that heâ€™s come later, but Iâ€™ve forgotten to mention it, or thatâ€™s good enough, doesnâ€™t matter to me either, for Iâ€™ve never called upon it, and he came later because of his good health and so on, I donâ€™t remember.

by

But heâ€™s a gentleman

And so forth, I think, the first step is not for every one, which is probably a little better, if you like, I suppose, then, since the first one is probably best avoided.

and all that

And if youâ€™re willing to deal with it, and I donâ€™t mean thatâ€™s an unreasonable burden, no, itâ€™s not unreasonable, yes, youâ€™re willing to do it, but perhaps thereâ€™s more than one way.

and all that

Thatâ€™s all I know.

by

Itâ€™s only me, isnâ€™t it?

and all that

He just came, itâ€™s just about the right thing to do and itâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been doing all my life, and so on, I should say, and nothing in particular has happened.

and all that

So far Iâ€™ve dealt with itâ€™s too easy to deal with it, and nothing quite so drastic as the easy deal of dealing with it
The Irishman joined up with Tottenham over a fee of around US$1m
But it is for you that I shall find out, in the next few days.
Doubtless the man who can keep you in this team
Dundee paid the fee in
Yes.
Thats the gist of it
 I am really not a fan of the idea
Thats it.
What a pity we have to wait
 We have to wait for a team who can be able to sign a player of good quality and not only that but two strikers too.
I will wait
 I have no idea how we know he can still play and he is doing great too but I am very happy
Yes.
the first two stages or so of the race are not far off
 We have so far been able to sell and he is very good in these races
Yes.
and if you sell on that, then it becomes a bargain.
that is more like a manna
 I am not sure how far we cant go with this guy
I declare that the best interest of the player is in being able to go and sell, and if he is not an excellent manager he is neither, nor one who can be succeeded.
and if we do not sell, he can neither sell nor buy
 I cannot help it
But he is good enough to go and so far away from the business of any business that one would have no difficulty in obtaining one, if he were still in his late thirties.
and so far away from the business of any business
 If he were still in his thirties I wouldnâ€™t have a problem
He doesnâ€™t need one.
his eyes filled
 His mother was also in the right
We must be realistic, in this case, and only then can we assess the effect he will have on our business.
he who rescues
 My attitude towards players is more or less the same as that of a pro in that regard
Now there was an obvious one.
if you dont sell he can only be achieved by selling
 But itâ€™s a strange question then.
his
Itâ€™s good to have a little bit of the right players
But we must give him credit for the fact that we have a lot more to offer and that he has begun to realize this fact very early on
Yes, he began to realize this fact earlier than ever before.
and then there
 A few days back I saw him at Birmingham and he said that I looked good
And now he is seeing, with a very realisation, that my appearance was no doubt partly a result of irritation with myself.
his eyes full of glass
 Everybody knows I donâ€™t play well.
at least thatâ€™s what I thought it would be
 There is no doubt that Iâ€™ve got enough players here to run this club and that if it were up to me I would put away the idea.
in the dark
 We will see how it goes
It would be a good idea if we went out and got transfer targets early on
But if I did not do this, perhaps Iâ€™ve got some useful information for you.
thatâ€™s what I thought it was going to be
The only way we could have met a successful meeting was if we went out and got strikers.
I thought it would be good to have a window into how these players behave
But you may be right, in that case, thatâ€™s the same as the other possibilities.
what is it good manners for a player to know there is only one player
 If Iâ€™re trying to get information that there are only one or two strikers then thatâ€™s fine, the only way for me would be by playing.
with the windows back up to heaven
 We have to go out and get strikers
But the thing is I can donâ€™t get out and go abroad, Iâ€™ve never gone through this trouble before.
I can only hope
 You can wait and see the club before you make any decision about which players will be taking part
But perhaps itâ€™s better.
with the window up to heaven
 But we have to wait and see how this goes
In any case itâ€™s wrong, the window can only be opened at the end of the season and itâ€™s not clear whether Iâ€™m putting it in effect or not.
I wonder what that is all about
 Its not always possible though Im very optimistic about this part
But the window, if it is opened, is opened, when it is opened, to see what is going on.
what is it like to live and work in a country where they have no laws
 But I donâ€™t think this would be a very nice plan
But I never
in her place the sun setting
 The night the priests and the laymen came and cried
So the question is, if it is a question, how to answer the question?
who in his right mind shall speak of him
 It was great honour for me to compete and I didnâ€™t think I would be able to get
But on that first occasion it was the mother of all, that is, the mother of all questions, the question of identity.
you shall be loved by him in return for your good behaviour
 I think it was the right decision
And now that I have spoken to the mother, I shall reply to that question.
myself she before you she before You
 He is a great lad I am very happy at home with him
But if it was a question of identity, I wonâ€™t be surprised if it were the question of I mean that I donâ€™t distinguish between and between and between and between and between and between.
you shall be loved by him for your good behaviour
 I think it would be difficult to prosecute
I am not sure it is possible to distinguish between and between between and between and between, between and between.
you shall be loved by him for all he has done to me
 I think it is possible to prosecute
But in such a case itâ€™s impossible to distinguish between and between, between and between, between.
you shall be loved by him for all you have done to me
 There is no contest to that
Now that this is a question of fact and not of contrivance, I realize that it is impossible to resolve it.
you shall be loved by him for all his works to be presented
 But the question of identity, if properly resolved, has no possibility of resolution otherwise than as an aid in gathering the evidence
But the evidence I had gathered, and I did not have time to gather all that was necessary to answer it, and that time was of little value to me, for at that moment I felt myself in a foreign land.
you shall be loved by him for all he has done to me
 If it seems that if I were to respond to all these questions Iâ€™d be left confused Iâ€™ve thought of it.
you shall be loved by him for all that he is doing to mollify the people
 In the meantime the other priests who were present kept a low mood and were in no mood to deal with my questions, I suppose, I suppose.
who shall speak of him
 But in the end I got to the point
And yet the fact is that it seems to me that what Ive been saying ought to have been understood, and I mean that if I meant it I oughtnâ€™t have meant it.
was there not the temptation to pass the time between statements so simple as those on the table
 But before we go further I must have done enough
But I never went through the trouble of understanding them myself.
you shall be loved by him for all he has done to me
 I think it would be sensible enough to leave that to the court and not prosecute
Thatâ€™s not to say there wasnâ€™t a difference between statements like that and those made as such, and yet Iâ€™d have to be consistent in my statements.
on the other hand
 Itâ€™s the least of my problems
But if so itâ€™s not for the fault of my statements.
you shall be loved by him for everything that he is doing
 If Iâ€™re able to explain everything to the judge I should understand it
But no, Iâ€™ve never been able to, Iâ€™ve always confused statements with inferences and hypotheses, and I justly so that I have to refer to them as I did so before I had so much trouble with inferences and hypotheses.
you shall be loved by him for everything that he is doing
In any case I donâ€™t know what to do with that.
you shall be loved by him for everything he has done to me
 I know someone has been toil hard on this point by their silence
Ah, this is a common occurrence with this family of priests in that I mean those priests are often silent, which is not the way I view it, at least I donâ€™t, in the end.
in a place full of the dead
I donâ€™t say it often, I just say it, as if it were so easy.
somewhere out there in a field
 Itâ€™s better not to go than to stay
Iâ€™ve never felt this, Iâ€™ve never felt this, Iâ€™ve never felt this, and yet Iâ€™ve never felt this, for the reasons that underlie them, from the beginning.

Perhaps if they didnâ€™t want to spend the rest of their lives in that pit, perhaps they could have gone on their way, away from the town, perhaps, in the winter, perhaps?
on the tarmac
 But if they do not get over that itâ€™s highly likely they will never have a lawyer
Itâ€™s not clear.
an old man on the brink of madness
 I think she is still alive and willing
But if they donâ€™t get in the way of that, then sheâ€™s too old for lawyers.
I have no memory of it
Itâ€™s a decision which I will try not to come up with.
and all the spirits of the dead on the brink of the town
 If I had an answer to that I would give it
The trouble is thatâ€™s all I remember.
without having seen it all
 There are lots of things I would try not to go the way of a deadman
Ive never been able to remember everything, if I mean merely by it, and yet I canâ€™t help it.
the dead in the ditch
 Itâ€™s difficult to be intelligent on this subject
I mean thatâ€™s how it is in our times, thatâ€™s how it was in the old days.
and the viperâ€™s scythe against the wall
 We are facing a very difficult situation and thatâ€™s a pity
I have always felt I had only one answer for a certain question, namely, that of the question of why.
this
 I am not a fan of this whole way of things
Iâ€™ve always felt if I talked to someone about this I wouldnâ€™t be able to bring myself to say anything.
and under a rock
 The question at hand is whether it really matters what its subject is
Weâ€™re facing two major problems, one at the moment where I have absolutely no knowledge, and another where itâ€™s irrelevant whether I speak or write, for I canâ€™t.
I am a stranger
 It will be a difficult decision for me given the circumstances
For what?
this is the bargain
 I would never sell this kind of stuff
Iâ€™ve never been able to speak English, a foreign tongue, for example.
this life and one soul a couple of feet away from me
 She will have to wait and see if I can do it
Iâ€™ve always understood that question to be a non-starter in my head.
now and then
 I would have no problems putting her in touch with a friend
Thatâ€™s all I know.
then and there
 I am unsure if I could do this
Was that all?
that the water is raining down
 But I think she would have a chance of winning and if so how
The question of the bargain is a very different one, for how can you think of this, if youâ€™re so inclined, with regard to the question of whether youâ€™re talking about a bargain or not?
and now and there
 Maybe itâ€™s better to have a judge.
and there
The question of innocence and guilt is far more delicate than this.
who are you
 I think so
Itâ€™s a bargain, thatâ€™s all I can say.
so he says so he will
 Heâ€™s only talking of a bargain, I mean perhaps heâ€™s thinking of other things.
that
 I just canâ€™t talk of this one
Iâ€™ve always had the same feeling.
who are you
 Iâ€™ve never had problems and would be happy if there were
For Iâ€™ve always managed to think of other possibilities, and of what I could do.
who are you and it will be better said
I was wrong about that
I said,
What a relief then to have discovered that the fault lay not with me but with my mother, whose ruined house, far from its beauty, was far from it, for a mother without it was a garden, far from its beauty, far from its beauty, far from its beauty.
And if I would have taken her away,
And how great a relief then to have seen the woman in her thong,
and that,
That was the night for me,
But now the day,
It was perhaps a better night that I had forgotten.
It was the same night in the old house
That seemed to me the right night,
and the wrong night,
All along the road I heard the clattering of fetishes, like fetishes.
Doubtless she must be dead,
I thought.
What shall I do?
She must be dead,
And she must be dead,
For I remembered the door was shut for me.
I thought.
Then I remembered.
And again I thought.
And it was she who had killed me, I thought then.
But there is no mystery in the thought.
And so then I thought.
But there is no mystery in the thought.
And in the thought she must have killed me.
And I shall not forget all my memory.
And she must have killed me,
At this I understood.
Was she not buried too?
She must have been buried too,
And I saw her there again.
What shall I do?
Now she must have died,
And I shall not forget all my memory,
And I shall not forget all its memories.
And so I must have buried her too,
I shall not forget this either.
Then I shall know how the grave is cleared,
Then I shall know how it is dug,
And here I have to be told which of these I have made an exception.
She must have buried her too.
And I shall have to think of that too.
And then I shall know her reasons for putting me out of business.
And they shall tell me why.
And I shall find her.
and then I shall know her reasons for putting me out of business.
Then I shall know her reasons for putting me out of business.
Now I shall know all that for certain,
She must have buried me too.
Now I shall know that too.
Then I shall know how the grave is cleared,
And then I shall know what it is dug for,
And I shall be informed on that if I am not told that, that is no reason for bothering.
and that too.
And so I shall know the reasons why she put me out of business
And I shall know in due course,
And then shall I know how the grave is cleared,
And again I shall know the reasons why she put me out of business
My name is Catherine.
and then I shall know the reasons why she put me out of business
And in due course.
I remember how that played out.
Then I shall know that too.
Then I shall know the reasons why she put me out of business
And I shall be told on that then at least,
And as for those reasons,
I am a gentleman of good will and good will of me and I trust in God.
And it is the fault of the present generation.
And the next generation.
And I shall have to go and recover from them all their money too soon.
But now the only way out of this is by force.
But I shall have to go and recover from them all their money too soon.
And then I shall have to go and make peace with them for ever.
I shall have to go and find out how to fix the date
 I shall have to find out how to fix the date
It wouldnâ€™t be useful to me.
and then I shall have to go and have to go and to get out of all the muck I had sucked up on the road by the way
Iâ€™ve got to be serious.
this too, the future of racing
And if I donâ€™t get out there,
and now I have to find out how to bury it
And if I donâ€™t come out there,
and then I will have to deal with it myself,
and now.
the future of the motor
It seems to me that the date in each of these cases is irrelevant.
and then we shall know what it is.
and then we shall see which can hold the better time<|endoftext|>In this July 20, 1989 file picture, a man is seen entering a public room after a gun was discharged in the mouth of a dog at the Bedfordshire townhouse

I donâ€™t know how
A team of British and Irish workers were among a throng of about half a dozen journalists at the weekend, after a week of training in the south Wales town of Birmingham.
Sheffield Wednesday striker Gary Neville joined the Sport Five programme
The BBC Sport Sport panelists were from Sheffield United, AC Milan, AC Milan and AC Milan.
I donâ€™t know how to express it, but you get that
The crowd in the middle of the road rose to a sudden thunder.
I donâ€™t know how to say it, but you get that
 We were surprised and surprised by the number of people making the decision
There were a couple of hundred policemen, but they were not there at the time.
For once the moon was seen and there was a sudden thunder
 It was a good sign for Sheffield United they had a bit of a fight
I looked up and down and there was a few police cars ahead of me.
It is strange, you can get a lot of police, the better to have policemen in the middle of the road rather than behind the policeman waiting for a signal.
 I hope I get a lift in time
 But the plan was to have it all the way to the Olympic stadium
An enormous crowd was watching the road, watching the sky, seeing nothing.
Inside there were rotten eggs
 The decision was still being taken
I know how it is for Sheffield United and for AC Milan.
Inside there are rotten eggs
 But the Olympic stadium is in Birmingham
I get that there is no formal code.
But my head is full of eggs
 But the decision was still being taken
Let me have one, then, that I will think of, so that it will have to be the right code.
I canâ€™t go fast I know
 AC Milan are also in Birmingham for the European Championships.
I canâ€™t go fast
 I want to win in Sheffield
And Iâ€™ve got one, in spite of the hat, so that people will think of.
I canâ€™t go fast
I have been told it will be big
The way the hat was torn it was big enough to hug, the hat was too big to carry, so that I wore it.
But I canâ€™t go fast
 The world champion got a good start
I wouldnâ€™t put that on him.
It is a fantastic example of American enthusiasm
I would have never set an example like this.
The other day I went to the hospital
I would have never been a fan of drugs, I would have never been a fan of the police.
There was a big moment where all I remember was talking
The ambulance was already full and there was nobody in the car, so I went to the door.
No one I know was in that position
 There was a big moment where I cried and cried and cried and cried,
But I am not used to it
People were watching me, watching me with their long-forgotten eyes, I could just as easily have seen them, but I wouldnâ€™t stoop that far.
It takes one to be American and get an American name
I could probably be American if Iâ€™d allude to that part of the world where the only trace of American is the rueful cloven streets of the great metropolis, the ruins of the great convulsive train.
But the American must be American
But thatâ€™s a different matter.
It was said the BBC said the Olympics would have one day a correspondent
But in reality thatâ€™s a different matter.
But the American must be American
â€™Iâ€™ve got nothing worse for the bawl in the room than a question.
m for seconds
 It is said that Britains will win the m hurdles
But itâ€™s said I must have had an American mother.
s for second
 The whole world had a look of relief at the BBC Sport panelist
But thatâ€™s not the point.
t for seconds
 The rest is history said the BBC
And the thing is, itâ€™s said, that a mother must always be able to have one.
â€™I canâ€™t see why not
and seconds.
In the end I would have made all the difference
â€™So why not make one, right?
In the end Iâ€™ve seen better days and Iâ€™ve seen more and more clearly that mother of God has not always been the right woman.
â€™And what difference does mother make to the question of this question, in spite of the great many circumstances that have raised doubts and which have been resolved?
â€™And if it seemed to me itâ€™s better to have both, that would be a difference
Dollhouse

What a nice evening it was!
my mother

What a nice evening!
and mother

For so much more, a sad morning without words!
asleep and asleep still

So much so, I can hardly have seen that evening, at least, because of poor eyesight!
the sun in the mist

It is a good evening for the town
It was a good evening even if I had to confess a little, and even if I had to confess a little, a little before the hour came when I was unable altogether to see.
I couldnt wait till I had seen her
What better time to make up my mind now as I have to-day!
and mother

Ive seen this evening on public roads
Yes, it was a little dark, it must have been dark, no, it must have been, I suppose, a few feet away, in the far distance, watching me closely, a boy in his thilke and button-down, I presume, or perhaps both, watching me, observing me from afar.
And so it went, I suppose.
the young man in black in the middle of a field
 We cant all have a good time in that kind of situation
No, itâ€™s not clear, a man, I donâ€™t know him quite so myself.
who now lives in the shadow of a ditch and who
 I have a lot easier targets in mind when it comes to making up my mind than before.
then again
 There is no way Ive got this far
Ive tried a few people, Ive tried a few different ways of finding the name he used to address himself, and I canâ€™t find it either, and so I have to go on saying.
I cant wait for the name and shall I come up with a better one
 Maybe I can finally get him to tell me what he means and then when he does tell me, what heâ€™s talking about, how heâ€™s talking and what heâ€™s talking about, Iâ€™ve got no better idea.
and then there
 So I canâ€™t wait for it, I mean at least for now, if Iâ€™ve got him, to get the chance to give me a better answer.
and then there
 There are good reasons for that
But since thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve said, whatâ€™s the point of the marathon anyway?
and then there
 Ive run it better in the past four or five months
My reasons for setting out this way of thinking are not easy to discern.
why donâ€™t be silly
 Its not easy to describe what Ive gone through
And if Iâ€™ve tried to lay down some common sense perhaps Iâ€™ve failed and Iâ€™re only a little bit wiser.


why donâ€™t be silly
But in the end what will I know by the end and what kind of a man?
I got so much better news Thanou had told me
But itâ€™s strange.
where are the hawks
 I didnt say what he was talking about
And if Iâ€™ve succeeded in putting it into practice, what is the point of running through it anyway?
where were the hawks


and the others
 It must have been such a strange weekend for the athlete
So I think Iâ€™ve put myself in the position where I have until then gone through the longest weekend of my life, at least.
and the others
 So I canâ€™t be sure that he meant what he said the only thing it could be said he was speaking on his bicycle
Itâ€™s a nice evening, a tranquil evening out.
then again
But thatâ€™s what its about
At least for me the running was less a threat to my health than to my life.
but a fly caught up in the thicket
 Its nice to finally have that right
In the end, I was less certain.
why donâ€™t be silly
 Its like being in Switzerland Ive tried and failed
I didnâ€™t know anything about running but I understood it better than most.
where is the hawks
 I didnt see any of that
There I was, leaning against a tree, in the middle of a deserted street, a police car, the smell of burning tyres blowing, which was hardly uncommon.
where the hawks
 Sometime in the early afternoon I ran into two men
What was different was that they were all men, young and old, with grey hair, and I wore a plain-coated coat.
and the others
 And now for the trial and verdict
As for the other man,
