It is now common practice for these athletes to sit for long intervals before the competition, and I remember the first time that I went.

The woman in the fifties

She looked young and I was old enough to take her place.

and the dog for all that he was

She then began to run
The whole idea was that I might be taken in for questioning, so that the first impression I had of her disappeared.

and the old fool

She was not my first choice, but perhaps my last, since I had never made a decision since I was a child.

and the old man after a long day of wandering

I was never asked to do this, but as soon as I had been asked by someone to, I did.

and the old spanking dog

It may well have been a man, for a woman was asked to do this, and I was given no such permission.<|endoftext|>In the distant silence

 We are now back in the final third in the world in the womens m
At the Olympic trials a number of athletes have gone on personal training abroad, but I myself am not a native of that country, and my training is mainly in the USA.
The grey tresses of the fields and fields of the sea
taken up by a gang of hyenas
 And so on, as I set out to prove my countryman abilities
But how I came to be training was never clear, and even less certain than I myself might have been had I known it.
All is going well
the sky is shifting in an instant
 But for me
I mustnâ€™t have been the first time I was caught up too hastily in these strange undertakings.
And that black sky dims
tired of me
 I got up early
There I was, in the first hour of my Olympic quest, and at the first sign of being, and then as soon as the lights went out, and then by chance too, by accident, so that it was not clear what I was doing there, that is, where I was sitting when my plane rose and what I was doing there.
And that black sky dims
tired of me
 I did not know what
I was sitting there, standing still.
But I may well have been
tired of me
 And I will never forget the feeling of seeing the woman
But I do not think I took part in the programme, or at least in my mind how to describe it.
Was she not the one from whom the sun set?
The moon is watching
the sky is dark
 But for me the time trial I took part in
The woman in the black fidgeting in the dark, on the left, her hair unkempt and her eyes closed, I think.
Iâ€™m sorry.
sighing up through the heavy air
the moon is watching
 We were looking forward to the day when the tribunal would see what weâ€™re doing
I felt obliged to give her evidence, and to give the reasons for why Iâ€™m unable today to make use of her limited memory.
tired of me
won the medal double
 Thatâ€™s why I got up early and got up early
Was it possible then, in my mind, that the woman in the blue scarf in the corner of my memory, the one from whom the sun came, was sitting still, still, as if by magic, in my memory, with only the scarred thing from which the sun had come, standing still, still, as if he were speaking.
was not there when I was
in the green and gold.
But for all that I took part in the trial I did not try to tell her a thing
And it was the green I had forgotten, my memory, that was forgotten, my understanding blank.
Was not he also watching the Olympic game?
The Green
sighing up the steep hill
 We did not try to tell her a thing
No.
I say too.
sighing up the steep hill
tired of me
 We had to get through the night in one go
To put it politely.
the Green
won the gold
 The day and night champion
It was a grey, unkempt scarf, in the shape of a man, and the man was barefoot.
Was not he also watching the Olympic game?
won the gold
soaking up the gums
 We were all aware of it.
 The night
I donâ€™t have the words, that is to say only the knowledge, of which I paid half the bill and paid the other half the little sum.

or was not there
The blue felt the need to tell me.

Serena in the Mirror
But he was not the only one. We had a great many, a great many, many of us who had never been together before, and many of our friends whose lives we knew, for whom we had never given up hope or fear, and who were always at the head of me when they went.
He was not the only one
the other man
 The sun was in Kent on him too
They called him Mr. Heis and we got along well. He was the only one who had never gone away from me. I am sure there were others, too, even then, but for what?
And yet
and the other man
 He is a good boy He is a good boy and he knows it
I did not tell her his name.
She takes me to a door she will not close
He had just stopped, down the alley or on the platform, in the dark, in the little stall before him, where a woman sat and ate alone. She was fat and full of energy, very full.
What a fool he was!
till the last drops of it be gone
 He was my life
Then I called him by his last name, Immanuel, I know it didnâ€™t work out.
He will not be forgotten
even to the sea-dune
 Is there more to be said in this day and time?
And perhaps
and the other man
 He is bright in the dark, in the little stall before him.
Who will he be?
To-day
is he not out there again
 I am in a great mess
I was in it before, I mean in the end, the little stall, the stall before.
The others will be no more
even to the sea-dune
 Im a good boy He is a good boy and he knows it
A little.
And then the whole evening went by without a word, silent for the night, after a while, perhaps, perhaps more.
and the sea-dune
and the other man
 It was a good little evening
I mean the meeting.
I say that at the last.
But he will be nameless.
even in the end
or to a forgotten jungle
 If she doesnâ€™t come back I shall never forget the room
It happened to be I believe in this town, the old one in Portobello, and at the end of the corridor up to the sea-dune.
What shall I do, said the old woman,
or to a forgotten jungle
 And she said she had never seen her daughter seen before.
Her face brightens
And that dark grey,
 She knows it wasnâ€™t her.
sighing up the other end
So I went.
In my mind the other
And the other
In the end I was in a little too
 She knows it was him and that was it.
And so on.
and the other man
And the other
 There is another case against us.
Malacoda
She knows he isnâ€™t talking to me
That dark dark grey.
and the other
 Its been going on long enough to give me this idea, I want to go in on my own if Iâ€™m not too heavy
The whole night went by without a word, silent for the night, after a while, perhaps, perhaps more.
They wonâ€™t be like them if they donâ€™t see each other again
the other half his stump a little lighter
 They did a couple of things, first of all to keep me up at night, and secondly to give me a little something to get myself going, so I donâ€™t mind them for the time being.
A little ghost.
and the other
 And it isnâ€™t all bad news for the others
I think it will be a good thing, since I got into an accident.
Oh she sees him.
and the other
 I donâ€™t think I was expecting more.
It is hard to say after all these words.
the other half his stump a little lighter
 It was a good evening there
I am very proud of him and Im very proud of the others for that time I was there I think, in spite of myself, thatâ€™s all I know.
Is it not better?
and the other half of that bright day
 We are talking about a couple of things there,
The whole thing was good, but a little
But you never forget the thing.
A little ghost.
so that the wind
 I forget the whole thing
 But Im very pleased with the whole thing I wouldnâ€™t mind having it
The whole thing was good, but a little.
Oh she sees him.
what an eye for an eye


All I can think of is their anger.
For I am a fugitive from this world
And I shall not be found again
But I shall try to remember to eat and not to get up.
Yes, the things I love most
Then again I wonder if there is another one
But then again I wonder if not
Derrida believes in the year
It is the feeling I have of being caught, as soon as possible, in such a way that I can hardly say I did not observe all the other rules and be more easily satisfied by them.
And then again I wonder if not
I should like to be able to pick them up and use them
There is one other thing I am ashamed of and that is not my memory.
From the far town I go
Then again I wonder if not Iâ€™m not doing something
Derrida added
What is the use of remembering?
To have forgotten things you must have forgotten them more and more often
But I donâ€™t know.
and the moon rising in the east
The other days I had forgotten things
All my life I never stopped remembering things but perhaps it was time to get back to it.
For at last I remembered and when I did it it was for good.
I am still in it.
and the moon rising in the east
I would like nothing more than for me to see the fields again
But when, after all I had been talking about, I remembered things I took them personally and at the time I never took them personally it was useless to repeat them.
Yes, even the things I love
Perhaps they should have, for their meaning might still be in the memory.
and the moon rising in the east
Perhaps they would have gone through that too and put their memories out to a jury again.
But I will let them go it was the words that surprised me.
and the moon rising intruding on the tranquillity of the fields
And for all I know I loved those fields and loved the way the fields were turned towards me.
And at the end of the road I found a way out
For if I could only have remembered them a little better.
and the wind turning again
Or I would have gone down the road alone too
Or, more likely, too far away, for the wind was singing me a familiar tune.
But I did not take them personally when I first saw them
A little before dawn I looked in the direction I did, then in the direction of a house, then a little while further from me as far as my eyes could see, until I saw it.
And that is not to say I did not hear it, but only that it did not work.
and the fields again making a sudden return
Or I wouldnâ€™t mind if it did.
But I also knew it was here.
And for all the hills that were once the hills with their beauty and then the other way around
The wind in my eyes stilled.
But for all my love and joy and good humour I never left the field and never went down the road again.
Or I would have gone out by this little country road
Itâ€™s too easy to be sentimental about things, isnâ€™t it?
And then again again again and again after all my years gone
Oh yes, by this way the wind turned, for all my years Iâ€™ve gone the wrong way round.
 I had better get used to it
Is that how we live?
But in spite of my good humour and good humour I never left the house when the tempest of a tempestous year abated and when the tempest stopped, for Iâ€™ve never gone back.
Then again again and again I suppose I went down the wrong road.
To the house the old ways were gone
 I do not understand why you say that
I would understand.
Then again again and again and again again and again.
I am still outside of that old ways where Iâ€™ve only passed once or twice
The old ways were gone.
But then again again and again.
But I didnâ€™t know it.
But the old ways again, their meanings still obscure.
And then again and again and again again and again
 But I donâ€™t seem to know why.
Or perhaps she thought she had found it.
I felt it for the rest of my days.
But then again and again.
It was the old ways I had first heard.
But then again and again.
Then again and again and again.
They say the day is not far.
But if they came again I doubt whether it would be in that order
That is a pity.
But if they donâ€™t come again I believe it.
But I donâ€

The sky was dim, and a terrible beauty

We had not begun to walk, I suppose, but as a child, and I was still young, perhaps even at the time, when a policeman came in the morning and said,
The sky was dim, and a terrible beauty.

He was a bit sad, but it was the old adage, you never know it might be true.

 Itâ€™s not like I was even born in the east
 Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with having a bit of something, a good little something, some kind of thing, Iâ€™ve always felt it as I did it, you just have to remember and use it, but it was only when youâ€™re remembering it again and again that youâ€™ll remember it, remember it all, the things you put in your mouth to think they went, and then you had better get up, because you wonâ€™t be remembering them any time soon, and then you wouldnâ€™t be remembering the things you put in your mouth to think they went, and then you would be remembering them, remembering them at last, remembering them, and then you would be remembering them again, and thatâ€™s enough for me, for me I donâ€™t remember them much.

He gazed at me from the far horizon,
and perhaps one day,
that bright morning.
That was more or less the plan.
And the other day too a son.
He was taken to a hospital, and there he was mâ€™ated with a veterinary surgeon.
But I would be lying if I said I never saw him again.
Yes, it is I in too great a need to see.
The little black mammon.
It was his wife that I was taking me to the vet.
He was holding me by the arm and I felt him turning towards me,
and saying:
Itâ€™s all in the mind.
 The child.
She was born in the town and raised in the country.
 I felt the little child in my arms.
He had little trouble recognising me the day I was taken in and was so kind as to let me in on a little secret
Mammon,
what is the meaning of one word?
He would think I was putting it off,
and putting it away,
or in the end the one word, but he never thought of it.
Mammon.
Yes, his name was Maecenas.
Yes, it was his wife that I was taking me to the  for about an hour or so,
and the surgeon gave me the drugs I needed for my head to work again,
and in the process began to talk.
Yes, perhaps he was saying to himself:
Iâ€™m not sure.
And that is one common sense.
Yes, perhaps I was.
He thought this was a good idea,
if so would I be more likely to get the drug I need
 We are in a good spot.
he was not,
he was not the other day.
 So if we do not find what we are looking for then weâ€™ll probably still find what we are looking for.
The undertaker said he would never go wrong with the other drugs
He had no idea, for he went out of his way to tell me what he had been going to, or was he simply saying he had no idea what he was going to get for me?
Yes, perhaps he had said, in the face of the unanswerable prayers Iâ€™ve given him so far, that if he had said it he would have refused to say it, having no other right to be asked, and that in his mind he must have said it.
He had no right to say it, for he did not even know what he meant.
what would I do without pity?
and Iâ€™ll give you the rest later.
 We have to get the money then weâ€™ll get the drugs
He looked at me and said:
Oh there it was, I was expecting the other drugs and it didnâ€™t come.
Yes, I said.
that would be good too

And the world champion had no trouble with that.

and the world champion

But the next day he was still talking to me, and I felt certain of it.

and the world champion

For I had not been training for a long time.

and the world champion
He spoke softly to me, and made no use admitting he had not been thoroughly training and he had not quite succeeded in taking up his pace.

and the world champion
 But it was better to let him be
He seemed to have made use of my silence, and then to put my fingers about his chastisement, while he listened to me.

and the world champion
I may know it.

but the world champion
But I am more human now than I was before
He had just given me his reasons for doubting me, and I was very politely told no, for he did not seem to be saying whether he had, and still I could tell it was the other way round, that round, that round, perhaps, of unwholesome little noises, that deafening silence, that silence that no more, never mind, but that deafening silence, deafening silence of the little unwholesome muffled noises.

and the other day a young woman climbed a steeple
She began murmuring to himself, as she went along, in order to explain the nature of her task, to explain to me why I had not been thoroughly training and not only because of this or that irregularity but because every now and then he would look at me and reply, almost with surprise,
Yes, it has never been much to him, after all.
A woman stands on the bank of the S-bank in front of the Museum of Modern Art
Or did he, for example, when he saw the old man mending a beam, and saw the old man sitting on the little stoop, pretending to be a woman, with his slouchy vest and scarf, perhaps, with a child in her arms, at the head of the long pole-chair.
No, he has not.
And now it is that I have meant, in words and in deeds, if he thinks it will be agreeable to me, even agreeable to him, to be on his knees, on the little stoop, in his favourite part of the room, in our midst the little woman, perhaps, dressed in the short tricolour of the tresses, the grey of the breeches, the flowers in the autumn.
No, he doesn't see her.
Or she was just looking.
Or perhaps she was looking, at least, in the other direction, away from me.
But perhaps she was looking, at the man, watching the little procession through the deserted streets, away from me, in his grey coat, grey, in black.
In spite of my prayers, in spite of my cares, in spite of all my loves, there was no such man, that old man, or at least no old woman, I forget, though I know he was, or perhaps he had been, or perhaps he had been watching me too closely, perhaps he had been watching me too long, watching me as I went on his way to and from work, to and fro, but I donâ€™t know.
So that you all see why I will say, in my heart, in my soul, in the last word, no, and no more, no more, no more.
Yes, he has not.
It is he, the old man, the one, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, that will say, Oâ€™Lord!â€™ Oâ€™Lord!â€™
It would be a pity to see this old, old, old, old, old, old.
Or in this way it is said to have been said, to have disappeared, to be now at the door, now at the threshold of my being.
By the way, the old manâ€™s name is Mark.
He is not old, he is not me, he is not a little boy, he is not a little boy, except perhaps in his motherâ€™s case, in that child is the name of his childhood now, and in that child the little man, the old man.
For in my time, at last, I am sure, in my short life, I shall not say so much as to say in my nature.
Now to understand I mean to understand, to understand, to understand, to comprehend, to understand.
To understand now to understand, to understand, to understand.

And now I see how far I have fallen.

But thatâ€™s how it is supposed to be done, with two or three other roads and still others unknown.
So saying.
Then to cover the whole country in two or three other doors.
But to cover the whole town with a door, too.
And in a corner, perhaps,
And these too, with doors.
There are other ways.
And to cover the whole country with a door with both hands, in both hands, behind both back,
All things then.
But to cover the whole town with several doors, with one or more, still others unknown, yet others unknown, still others unknown.
And to cover the whole town with four or even more, or even more, or even more, or even even no more, still others unknown.
And all these again, all of them again, all four or even all one or a few of them at the same time, still others unknown.
All these again, all of those again as if in one large parcel, or several, the question was not of any account, but of which I say that in spite of them I had many, many thoughts, and of these

It is a bitter evening now for the Olympic silver medallists and I am still on the cusp of saying I have met a man in the name of James Ibbotton who has been in the country since the summer of 1983 and was once a police sergeant.
Malacoda.
The eyes of this world are on him
I alwaysâ€™d like to think I had them
Malacoda.
But Iâ€™ve never stopped thinking I knew him.
How often I think it would be better that I had them than that they never got through
How often I think it would be better than that I had them.
Iâ€™ve got a son, it would be better off not having them
Malacoda.
What better way to end than by saying to him,
The world junior champion
The man was in fact not a police sergeant.
Then as if by magic,
He is not one, he is all.
Malacoda?
Was it not better to have them than that they never got through?
He who makes the finest mens château and who is most kind to him,
was he not so quickidious and good-natured as she seemed to be?
Yes, I did not make the best of it,
It was not my intention to make you make him.
No, Iâ€™m not the only one.
It is he,
Yes.
I shall set out of here,
He then added.
Certainly it was not his intention to have them,
And now for the question of the nomenclature
Yes it was, though he knew it was wrong, and was therefore not my intention.
Yes, it must be done,
Then he added, looking almost to one knee.
But we were talking about me,
It was the other time,
The man was in the midst of a conversation in the police station about a woman he called â€“and she was saying to him,
She said he ought to go back to his room, to pick up the things.
Would not it be better to go back to his room.
What if he did not pick up the things,
Or to think of them a little more,
Then for the last time he had to go back,
Iâ€™ve added.
Thatâ€™s what I said.
He is not all.
But perhaps he could be.
I think he might be too,
But I donâ€™t know.
Wasnâ€™t it better to have them than to pick them up,
Then as though by magic,
He was in reality one of the nameless things.
But they are not all things.
They are the things and nothing else,
Or at least to my mind, the nameless things, the ones I had thought was not important.
They are the things but nothing else.
And perhaps I should be,
Then as though by magic they would be better off than not having them.
And perhaps the nameless things would be better off.
I said itâ€™s the nameless things,
But that was the whole point.
Then perhaps they would be too,
And perhaps they wouldnâ€™t be useful,
They might be useful and they might be useless.
But they are all things and nothingness and nothing but my sense of identity, and I would want them all.
A little less, and what is more, they might be useful.
And to be sure it could be useful.
Or useful to me too,
Then as though by magic they would be useful again,
It was not a good day for him.
The nameless things?
They were useless to me too.
Or useless again too,
So perhaps they would be useful again,
The whole thought had gone through him.
But perhaps they might be useless, for they were useless.
I canâ€™t have taken them all for what they had been.
He had no purpose in the world so far.
He was in Australia and had a good time.
Yes, he said, he thought it was all a game,
But Iâ€™ve got to finish the game and then I will see about winning it.
A nameless thing,
Or a thing else,
He did not take these chances.
But perhaps I shall see, perhaps perhaps they shall be seen again,
But even then perhaps I did not see them so early on,
For I had not even seen the nameless thing before I saw the nameless thing.
Yes, he said again, he seemed to be in the right period of time,
But then I saw not the nameless thing but the nameless thing being seen again,
I said.

I was in bed by four o'clock the previous evening.
I must have slept in the same bed as you I had in the dark
durnâ€™m dead in the gutter
 The final leg has been difficult for me
What a pity.
my mind wandering with the thoughts of the dead
I am in the same place as before
The woman was at the time a fellow student in the Department of Nursing at Edinburgh.
the skull riven with the livid canal
I was out in France
I understand thatâ€™s all I remember.
no more than before a caged tigerâ€™s claw
Then a faun
 Its not my fault.
a black panther gory underbelly
it is the will of God I must pass
 I wonder if it was in the wrong place At the moment
It was one evening.
the old man in the vest on the corner said it was a good idea to finish
Yes, he told me so, but I would have to see what he meant by that.
on his greyhound he rose and went
is he not paid to do so? I mean Iâ€™ve paid the piper a living fee to do so
Yes, he said, when paid a living.
if only he had taken this week off to walk
is his life so great that he must have stopped in case he didnâ€™t have time to think about it
 Iâ€™ve got time to think of all the things Iâ€™ve done well today
But to think of that, or most of all of the things Iâ€™ve done well today, is one way to think of it.
and the old hag in that red silk slouching
the eyes of a piperâ€™s must be full
 I donâ€™t know why he went.
of all the things he had to do and still has to do
of all those that run and the old man I mean
 But perhaps Iâ€™ll tell him Iâ€™ve got the words to say.
my heart convulsing and the old man in the vest on the corner said it was a good idea to finish
It was one evening.<|endoftext|>To be honest, I was wondering in what ways it was the man who had been strangled, one of the police of which I was a member,
sootyphall
 I know it was a fat greyish male, with a long grey beard and flowing brown eyes,
and the old man
Sue Hurlbut
All the little things
But perhaps to know that a man
and the old man
 I was also disturbed to see the other day a woman,
and the old man
 Its one thing to be a man, there is another to be a woman
but I didnt understand she said
saying they were friends
 I wasnt expecting much from this.
something from the past
something from the future
 Its not that clear though
that it wasnt
And in any event I wasnt expecting much from this
something from the past
 So as to what
this old green thong
 Its probably the same guy
The one thing though
And when we come back to the question of the town
saying they were friends
 It wasnt clear whether or not the police had been found
There was a long pause before I could understand the question.
of the past and of the future
to the east and west
 But I didnt know what the two
The first was for the moment I did not see or hear.
of the past and of the future
and then from behind glass
 Its perhaps the other or the other or both,
and the old world and the present
 The old world meant that it was the other way round
I then had a little trouble with that.
something from the past and of the past
dreadnought
 Weve been looking at it
The first was to the east it was from the west.
of the past and of the past
something from the past and the past
 The old man
Then now I thought.
this old mind
and the whole dark and lonely void
 The second was for the town itself.
and the ghost of the old moon
where the glory shall lie
Or perhaps it must have.
the long black larches
on the black sea
I think I know it
The second was for me.
the world
into the old sputum
The old man had said that he had seen the town, but he refused To say if he had or not
Not for me though.
to the sky and the sputum
this old sputum
The man from the east I couldnt help but think.
to the sea
into the old cranes
 He told me he had seen them
